\description{
An experiment conducted by Blackman et al. (1988) and documented in the following
\href{https://github.com/VMatthijs/Slamming-the-sham}{GitHub repository} by Vakar
and Gelman. The dataset consists of a large number of experiments (\code{tau}, \code{se.tau})
repeated at varying wave frequencies. Sham experiments (\code{mu}, \code{se.mu}) are also
included, allowing us to compare performance of models with and without
control measurements.
