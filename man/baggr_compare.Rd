\title{(Run and) compare multiple baggr models}
\usage{
baggr_compare(
  ...,
  what = "pooling",
  compare = "groups",
  transform = NULL,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Either some (at least 1) objects of class \code{baggr}
(you should name your objects, see the example below)
or the same arguments you'd pass to \link{baggr}.
In the latter case you must specify \code{what} to compare.}

\item{what}{One of \code{"pooling"} (comparison between no, partial and
full pooling) or \code{"prior"} (comparison between prior and
posterior predictive). If pre-existing baggr models are
passed to \code{...}, this argument is ignored.}

\item{compare}{When plotting, choose between comparison of \code{"groups"}
(default) or (hyper-) \code{"effects"}. The former is not available
when \code{what = "prior"}.}

\item{transform}{a function (e.g. exp(), log()) to apply to
the values of group (and hyper, if hyper=TRUE)
effects before plotting; when working with
effects that are on log scale,
exponent transform is used automatically,
you can plot on log scale by setting
transform = identity}

\item{plot}{logical; calls \link{plot.baggr_compare} when running \code{baggr_compare}}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{baggr_compare}
}
\description{
Compare multiple \link{baggr} models by either
providing multiple already existing models as (named) arguments or
passing parameters necessary to run a \link{baggr} model.
}
\details{
If you pass parameters to the function you must specify
what kind of comparison you want, either \code{"pooling"}, which
will run fully/partially/un-pooled models and then compare them,
or \code{"prior"} which will generate estimates without the data
and compare them to the model with the full data. For more
details see \link{baggr}, specifically the \code{ppd} argument.
