\title{Compare a(ny) number of baggr models side by side}
\usage{
baggr_compare(..., style = "areas", arrange = "single")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Either any number of objects of class \code{baggr}
(you can name your objects, see the example below)
or the same arguments you'd pass to baggr()
function, but with \code{pooling = ...} omitted.
In the latter case 3 models will be run, with
pooling set to \code{none}, \code{partial} and \code{full}.}

\item{style}{What kind of plot to display (if \code{arrange = "grid"}),
passed to \code{style} argument in \link{baggr_plot}}

\item{arrange}{If \code{single}, generate a comparison single plot;
if \code{grid}, display multiple plots side-by-side.}

\value{
\code{ggplot} graphic is rendered

\examples{
\donttest{
# Most basic comparison between no, partial and full pooling
# (This will run the models)
baggr_compare(schools)

# Compare existing models:
bg1 <- baggr(schools, pooling = "partial")
bg2 <- baggr(schools, pooling = "full")
baggr_compare("Partial pooling model" = bg1, "Full pooling" = bg2,
              arrange = "grid")

# You can also compare different subsets of input data
